# Python
This is me trying to learn how to code in Python!

I reckon that I'd subscribe to the philosophy that to really understand and learn a language like Python (or any other language for that matter) then you really got to solve some problems or challenges in that language. Thinking about a solution to a problem will force newbies to start to investigate what the language has on offer - and in Python's case that includes a plethora of packages to pick from as well as the standard packages that come straight out of the box.

So, I've decided to gather together the solutions to some problems/challenges that I've set myself or come across here - I really like Python and I hope I get better...

[Google Challenge Problems](google-challenge-problems)

I didn't realise that if you type in a techie sounding search into www.google.com that you'd then be presented with coding challenges - admittedly I think it's a HR exercise for Google but it's still an interesting way to practice your Python and learn.

[country codes](country-codes)

I read something, somewhere on the web about a guy who was trying to get a list of country codes in JSON - a bit like below. So I thought it might be a good exercise to do some web scrapping.
```python
...
"Togo": "TG",
"Tokelau": "TK",
...
```

[Random bits and bobs bucket](random-probs)

Just a collection of my take on solutions to some problems I come across
